Ethereum Based Crypto Currency

Steps to create your own digi tokens
This step by step guide will explain the steps to build a custom cryptocurrency on ethereum platform. It will be a minimalist approach. By the end of this post, you will be able to create a custom token and deploy it on a testnet (ropsten network) and play around with it. There is no programming experience needed, just follow the steps/images circled with red ovals and copy/paste the coding part .

These are some tools which will be required

Ethereum — the blockchain platform
Remix — online Editor for writing smart contracts in solidity
MetaMask — ethereum client, which will interact with the test network (ropsten)
wallet.etherum.org — online wallet to check and send tokens

STEP 1: Install Metamask and load free ether in rospten test network
Open chrome and install metamask by clicking the link. Metamask is an ethereum client for browser

Click on the fox icon that will appear on the right hand side top corner of the browser and follow the steps in the infographic to load free ether. Ether is the cyrptocurrency for ethereum platform.

refer to the above given link in order to install metamask and use it.

The ethereum address is similar to a bank account number
ex: "0xd5105520Edd8Bc3AFC47cA242B0d983F7F6349d0". Keep the address handy it will be used later.

This is the main account address. At this point the address will have 1 ether. If you don’t get an ether, post your address in the comments section. I will transfer 1 ether to you. Ether is needed for deploying the code into test network.

STEP 2: Create a custom currency and deploy it to Kocan Test network

The smart contract for creating custom token is written in solidity.
Open Remix online editor, remove the existing Ballot code, copy and paste the below source code.(If you are not able to copy, click the “view raw” at bottom right corner of the code snippet)
